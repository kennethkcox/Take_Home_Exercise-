# Custom Falco rules can be added here.
# For example, to detect if a shell is run in a container:
#
# - rule: Terminal shell in container
#   desc: A shell was used in the container, which is suspicious.
#   condition: evt.type = execve and evt.dir = < and container.id != host and proc.name = sh
#   output: "Shell in container (user=%user.name container_id=%container.id)"
#   priority: WARNING
#   tags: [shell]
